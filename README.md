# My GitHub Pages Website

This is a simple static website you can host for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## How to Deploy

1. **Push these files to a GitHub repository** (public or private).
2. Go to your repository’s **Settings > Pages**.
3. Select the branch (usually `main`) and root (`/`) folder.
4. Save. After a minute, your site will be live at  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

Feel free to edit `index.html` and `style.css` to make it your own!
